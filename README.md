# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning-based system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and classify diseases in plant leaves from images. The system aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant diseases early, thereby improving crop health and yield.
